# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

Hi! I'm a backend developer focused on building **asynchronous Python services**, **Telegram bots**, and **external API integrations**. My portfolio includes both academic and commercial projects with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, automation, and reliability.

---

## 🧰 Technologies I Work With

### 🖥️ Backend & API
- **Python 3.10+**
- **FastAPI** – high-performance REST and WebSocket APIs
- **Aiogram** – Telegram bots with FSM (Finite State Machine) support
- **httpx** – async HTTP requests to external APIs
- **Pydantic / pydantic-settings** – data validation and environment configuration
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** – secure authentication and access control

### 🗄️ Databases & Caching
- **PostgreSQL** – relational database (used with async access)
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0** – modern declarative ORM
- **asyncpg** – fast PostgreSQL driver
- **Redis** – for caching, session storage, and pub/sub messaging

### 📦 DevOps & Tooling
- **Docker** – containerized environments for local and production use
- **.env / Environment Variables** – secure and configurable runtime settings
- **Ruff** – blazing fast Python linter and code formatter
- **Logging** – detailed and structured logs for debugging and monitoring

### 📄 Formats & Integrations
- **OAuth2 ** – authentication and data access with external services
- **openpyxl** – Excel export with formatted resume data

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🛤️ Metro Simulation System
REST + WebSocket service simulating a metro transportation network:
- Lines, stations, trains, and passenger interactions
- Real-time state updates
- PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy backend

### 🤖 Commercial Telegram Bot (hh.ru integration)
- Search and filter resumes from hh.ru
- FSM-driven user flow via Telegram bot
- OAuth2 token refresh management
- Exports filtered resumes to Excel
- Built with aiogram + httpx + PostgreSQL + Docker

---

## 🛠️ Development Principles

- Asynchronous and scalable architecture (`asyncio`-based)
- Modular codebase using clear separation of concerns
- Production-ready practices with logging, environment configs, and Docker
- Linting and formatting with **Ruff** for clean, maintainable code
